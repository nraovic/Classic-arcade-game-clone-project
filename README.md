Frontend Nanodegree Classic Arcade Game Clone project
===============================

The goal of this project is to build **object-oriented** Frogger game including the player characters and enemies. The visual assets and a game loop engine are provided. 

The game is build using ES6 features, and Babel is used to transpile the ES6 code to ES5. The transpiled code is located in _dist_ folder.

## How to run the game
