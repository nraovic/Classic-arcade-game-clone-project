Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How to run the game
1. Open index.html
2. Choose your character, insert your name and press _Let's start the game button (this will redirect you to game.html)

## How to play the game
* Use arrow keys to move right, left, up and down
* You have three lives
* Your goal is to reach the water without colliding with the enemies
* When you reach the water, you will automatically be set off to the initail position
* In order to **win** you have to collect **60 points**, which equals reaching the water three times
